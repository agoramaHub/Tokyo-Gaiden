## Tokyo_Map framework read me

This is a simple dynamic platform that was conceived to be an interactive mind map of sorts..
The work was produce for the art Petra Szem√°n for the exhibition Geltung[Validity](http://agorama.org.uk)'s online component.

The core idea behind the platform is to have point on a visual background that highlight when a user
interacts with the element, and when clicked activate a popup window. In this model, this is achieve
through the use of three Javascript libraries: JQuery (3.2.1), Bootstrap's js file, and tether.js.

To see the final product of this artistic collaboration please visit: http://tokyo-gaiden.agorama.org.uk/

Please note I have included the original place holder images with this shell as a working demo. I by no means
own this visual content - and are not *Licensed* what so ever by myself or agoramaHub - they are for demo
purpose only.
